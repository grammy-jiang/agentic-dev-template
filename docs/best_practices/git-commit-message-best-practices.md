# Best Practices for Writing Git Commit Messages

## Introduction

Writing clear, descriptive **Git commit messages** is essential for both solo
developers and contributors to open-source projects. Good commit messages act as
a communication tool – they explain *what* changed and *why*, making it easier
for you (and others) to understand the history of a project. High-quality
messages can speed up code reviews, simplify debugging, and provide context that
isn’t obvious from the code alone【2†L39-L47】. In open-source projects, many
maintainers enforce specific commit message guidelines, so following best
practices (or the project’s conventions) is often a requirement.

## Writing Effective Commit Titles and Bodies

A commit message typically consists of a **title (subject line)** and an
optional **body**. The title should be a short summary of the changes, and the
body can include additional details, context, or reasons for the change.
Adhering to a consistent style for both the title and body makes the commit
history more readable and useful. Below are key guidelines for writing effective
commit titles and bodies:

- **Use an Imperative, Present-Tense Title:** Write the commit title as if
  giving a command or finishing the sentence “If applied, this commit will…”.
  For example, use *“Add login feature”* instead of *“Added login
  feature”*【2†L52-L60】. The imperative mood (“Add”, “Fix”, “Update”) describes
  what the commit *does*, not what you did in the past【2†L64-L67】. This style is
  standard because many tools (and Git itself) expect the subject to complete
  that implicit sentence.

- **Capitalize the First Word of the Title:** Begin the subject line with a
  capital letter【2†L69-L77】. This follows natural writing conventions and gives
  your commit log a consistent appearance. (Some projects may allow lowercase if
  they prefer, but choose one style and stick to it【2†L79-L85】.)

- **Keep the Title Concise (\<= 50 Characters):** It’s recommended to limit the
  subject line to ~50 characters【4†L197-L204】. This ensures the summary is brief
  and that it displays well in `git log` and other tools. If you can’t summarize
  in 50 characters, the change might be complex enough to warrant explanation in
  the body. Include any extra detail in the body rather than making the title
  too long.

- **Separate Title and Body with a Blank Line:** If you write a longer
  description, leave one blank line after the title line. This separation is
  important – many tools treat the first line as the subject and the rest as the
  body. Omitting the blank line can confuse utilities like `git log` and
  `git rebase`【4†L232-L240】.

- **Use the Body to Explain *Why* and *How*:** The commit **body** (if needed)
  should provide context: **why** the change was made, and any details about
  **how** it was done or **what** it affects. Avoid simply restating the code
  diff. For example, instead of writing *“Updated algorithm X to fix bug”*
  (which just rephrases the code), explain the root cause or motivation:
  *“Improve algorithm X to prevent memory leak (the previous approach did not
  release resources properly).”* Focus on the reasons and implications of the
  change【2†L111-L119】. A good body can include background information,
  reasoning, and any side effects or follow-up actions required【4†L241-L249】.
  Wrap the body text at around 72 characters per line for readability in
  terminals【4†L197-L204】.

- **Avoid Empty or Generic Commit Messages:** Every commit should have a
  descriptive message. Do not use placeholders or terse notes like *“Fix
  stuff”*, *“Changes”*, or *“Update”* without context【2†L152-L160】. These convey
  little to no information to others (or your future self). Instead, describe
  *what* you fixed or updated – for example, *“Fix null pointer exception in
  user login flow”* is far more informative than *“Fix issue”*. If the project
  is small and a single word is truly sufficient (e.g., *“README”* for a readme
  typo fix), that can be acceptable – but in general, err on the side of
  clarity.

- **Be Specific and Mention Affected Scope:** When possible, mention the
  component or module that the commit affects. For instance, instead of
  *“Improve performance”* on its own, say *“Improve caching in user profile API
  for better performance”*. This gives readers a quick idea of where the change
  is applied. In the commit title, you might include a scope in parentheses
  (especially if following certain conventions, discussed later). For example,
  *“fix(cache): prevent redundant writes to disk”* indicates the area of code
  (`cache`) that is impacted.

- **Stick to One Intent per Commit:** A commit message should reflect a singular
  focus or intent. Avoid bundling unrelated changes in one commit; if you do,
  the message becomes either too vague or overwhelmingly long. Each commit
  should address one logical change, so that its message can stay on topic and
  concise. This also makes it easier to revert or cherry-pick if necessary.

- **Avoid References to the Commit Itself or the PR:** Write the message as an
  objective description of the change, **not** as meta-commentary. Phrases like
  “this commit…”, “this change…” or “in this PR…” are unnecessary【2†L167-L175】.
  Similarly, avoid personal pronouns (e.g., “I fixed…”); instead of *“I updated
  the UI”*, say *“Update UI to improve accessibility”*【2†L189-L195】. The commit
  is already understood to be the thing doing the change, so just state the
  change.

By following these guidelines, your commit title and body will be informative
and professional. For example, compare the following:

- *Good:* **“Increase left padding between textbox and layout frame”** – This
  clearly states the UI change made, without having to inspect the
  code【2†L99-L107】.
- *Bad:* **“Adjust css”** – This is too vague; it doesn’t indicate what was
  changed in the CSS or why【2†L99-L107】.

In the good example, anyone reading the log knows exactly which aspect of the UI
was adjusted. In the bad example, a future reader would have to dig into the
diff to understand the change. Always aim to write the message so that reading
it alone gives a decent understanding of the commit.

## Structure and Elements of a Commit Message

A well-structured commit message typically has three components: a **header**,
an optional **body**, and an optional **footer**【22†L12-L20】. Understanding
these elements will help you include all necessary information:

- **Header (Title):** This is the first line of the commit message and is
  **required**. It contains a brief summary of the changes. Many conventions
  (described in the next section) structure the header as
  `<type>(<scope>): <description>`. Even if you’re not following a specific
  convention, your header should succinctly describe the change in one line. For
  example, *“Fix memory leak in image processing module”* is a clear header.
  Some projects prefix the header with a tag or component name (scope) in
  brackets or parentheses, e.g. *“database: optimize index creation”* – this is
  project-specific style. The header should be in imperative mood and \<= 50
  characters as noted earlier.

- **Body:** The body is optional and used for detailing the commit. If the
  change is not trivial, you should add a body. Start the body after one blank
  line below the header【22†L15-L20】. In the body, explain *why* the change was
  needed and *what* it does in more depth. Include any relevant background,
  reasoning, and details that help the reviewer or future maintainers. For
  example, if fixing a bug, you might describe the root cause and why the fix
  addresses it. If adding a new feature, you might mention why the feature is
  necessary or how it works. Keep the body wrapped at ~72 characters per line
  for readability. Focus on implications or motivations rather than
  regurgitating code changes【2†L111-L119】. If the commit is straightforward and
  self-explanatory, the body can be omitted – but don’t hesitate to include one
  for non-trivial changes.

- **Footer:** The footer is also optional and typically used for metadata such
  as issue trackers, reviewers, or breaking change notices【22†L27-L30】. Common
  elements in the footer include:

  - **Issue references:** If the commit relates to an issue or ticket, reference
    it here. For example: *“Closes #123”*, *“Fixes BUG-456”*, or *“See also:
    #789”*【4†L255-L259】. This signals to project management tools that the issue
    can be moved or closed, and helps others trace why a change was made.
  - **Breaking change notice:** If the commit introduces a backward-incompatible
    change, it should be indicated in the footer. A common convention (from
    Conventional Commits) is to start a line with **BREAKING CHANGE:** followed
    by an explanation of what changed and what consumers of the code must do to
    adapt【22†L27-L30】. Example: *“BREAKING CHANGE: Updated authentication API to
    v2; existing tokens will no longer work.”* This warns developers that
    pulling this commit requires additional action.
  - **Co-authorship and sign-offs:** In collaborative projects, if multiple
    people contributed, you might add *Co-authored-by:* lines in the footer.
    Additionally, many open-source projects (especially those under the Linux
    Foundation) require a **“Signed-off-by”** line, which is your certification
    that you have the rights to contribute the code (per the Developer
    Certificate of Origin)【4†L290-L299】. For instance: *“Signed-off-by: Jane Doe
    <jane.doe@example.com>”*. Always check the contributing guidelines of an
    open-source project to see if sign-offs or other footer tags (like
    *Reviewed-by*, *Tested-by*, etc.) are needed.

Here’s a quick example of a well-structured commit message combining these
elements:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

Implemented OAuth 2.0 login using the external provider library.
This change introduces a new callback endpoint and updates the
user model with OAuth tokens.

BREAKING CHANGE: The login API now requires an OAuth token,
so existing login calls without a token will fail.

Closes #42
```

- The **header** uses a type (`feat`), an optional scope (`auth`), and a
  description.
- The **body** explains what was done and why (new endpoint, model update).
- The **footer** indicates a breaking change (so developers know to adjust their
  usage) and references issue #42 that is resolved by this commit.

Not every commit will have all these parts (for example, a simple documentation
typo fix might just have a brief header). The goal is to include the relevant
elements that add clarity. At minimum, always have a clear header line. Include
a body whenever additional explanation would be helpful, and use the footer for
any ancillary information or required references.

## Commit Message Conventions and Styles

Over time, the developer community has established several **commit message
conventions** – standardized formats that make commit histories more uniform and
sometimes enable automated tooling. Adopting a convention can be especially
helpful in open-source projects or larger teams where consistency is key. Here
we compare a few popular conventions:

### Conventional Commits

**Conventional Commits** is a widely-used standard for structuring commit
messages. It prescribes a simple format: a **type**, an optional **scope**, and
a **description**【28†L4-L12】, all in the header line. For example:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

A commit following Conventional Commits might look like:
**`feat(ui): add dark mode toggle`**. Here, `feat` is the type, `ui` is the
scope, and “add dark mode toggle” is the description. The types are predefined
keywords that categorize the nature of the commit. Common types include **feat**
(new feature), **fix** (bug fix), **docs** (documentation changes), **style**
(code style/format changes not affecting logic), **refactor** (code
refactoring), **perf** (performance improvement), **test** (adding or fixing
tests), **build** (build system or dependency changes), **ci** (CI configuration
changes), **chore** (other minor tasks), and **revert** (reverting a previous
commit)【22†L35-L43】. The scope is optional and indicates the part of the
codebase affected (e.g. `auth`, `database`, `login-page`). The description is a
short summary of the change in that area.

**Benefits:** Conventional Commits bring clarity and consistency【28†L20-L24】.
Because every commit message follows a pattern, it’s easy to scan a log and pick
out types of changes. Importantly, this convention enables **automation**: tools
can parse commit messages to generate changelogs, release notes, or determine
semantic version bumps. For instance, you can automatically bump the version of
a project based on commit types (patch/minor/major) and list features and fixes
in a CHANGELOG. Many projects use Conventional Commits to enforce meaningful
messages and integrate with CI/CD. It also encourages thinking in terms of the
purpose of each commit (feature, fix, etc.), which can improve the discipline of
making focused commits.

**Example:**

- **`feat(auth): add OAuth 2.0 authentication flow`** – A new feature in the
  “auth” component【28†L14-L18】.
- **`fix(ui): correct button alignment in header`** – A bug fix in the “ui”
  (user interface) part of the app【28†L50-L53】.
- **`docs: update README installation section`** – Documentation changes (scope
  omitted in this case).

Conventional Commits also define how to mark breaking changes. You can append an
exclamation mark to the type (e.g. `feat!:`) **or** include a “BREAKING CHANGE”
in the footer. For example, `refactor!: drop support for Node 14` would indicate
a breaking change in a refactoring commit. This ties into semantic versioning: a
`feat` implies a minor version bump (new functionality), `fix` implies a patch
bump, and a `!` (breaking) implies a major bump, if you use those tools.

### Gitmoji

**Gitmoji** is a convention that uses emojis at the start of commit messages to
categorize them. Each emoji represents a type of change – for example,
:sparkles: (✨) for a new feature, :bug: (🐛) for a bug fix, :memo: (📝) for
documentation, :lipstick: (💄) for UI style changes, and so on. A Gitmoji commit
message might look like
**`✨ Add new login flow with multi-factor authentication`**【28†L28-L36】. Here
the sparkle emoji indicates a feature. Some teams use the emoji **in addition**
to Conventional Commit types, e.g. **`✨ feat: add new login flow...`** combining
both for maximum clarity【28†L28-L36】.

**Benefits:** Gitmoji adds a fun, visual element to commit history. It can make
commit logs more scannable – the emoji provides an immediate hint of the
commit’s category【28†L28-L36】. For developers who are very visual or who simply
enjoy the expressiveness of emojis, this convention can improve the developer
experience. It’s also language-neutral (an emoji transcends English labels like
"feat" or "fix"). Gitmoji has an official list of emoji meanings, so teams can
agree on what each symbol stands for.

**Considerations:** Emojis aren’t as machine-readable for automation unless
paired with a text convention. They rely on the developers’ familiarity with the
symbols. Also, not everyone’s development environment or tooling may render
emojis properly. However, many teams successfully use Gitmoji alongside
Conventional Commits to get the benefits of both structure and visual cues
(e.g., an emoji followed by a Conventional Commit header)【28†L48-L53】.

**Example:**

- **`🐛 fix: handle null pointer in login flow`** – Bug fix (with bug emoji and
  Conventional type).
- **`✨ feat: add profile picture upload`** – New feature (sparkles emoji +
  type).
- **`📝 docs: update contributor guidelines`** – Documentation change (memo emoji
  \+ type).

*(In pure Gitmoji usage, one might omit the text `feat:`/`fix:` labels and just
write the summary after the emoji, but combining them with a structured type is
common and recommended for clarity.)*

### Angular (Karma) Style

Before Conventional Commits was formalized, many projects (notably AngularJS)
used a similar **Angular commit message style**, sometimes called the *Karma*
style (from the Angular project’s commit guidelines). This format was the direct
inspiration for Conventional Commits【28†L36-L39】. It also uses a structure like
`<type>(<scope>): <description>`, with essentially the same set of types (feat,
fix, docs, etc.). For all practical purposes, if you adhere to Conventional
Commits, you are aligned with Angular’s style as well. One difference is that
Angular’s convention was originally documented as part of their contributing
guide and had a specific vocabulary and rules (for example, the Angular
convention might emphasize the **imperative mood** and a separate footers
section for breaking changes and issue links, just like Conventional Commits).
If you see references to “Karma style” or “Angular commit conventions,” know
that they align closely with Conventional Commits in spirit and
syntax【28†L36-L39】.

**Example:** *"fix(router): handle undefined route config"* – would be a typical
Angular-format commit indicating a fix in the `router` component. The benefits
(consistency, clarity, semantic versioning support) are the same as Conventional
Commits, since it's essentially the same concept.

### Semantic Commit Messages (General)

The term **“semantic commit messages”** is sometimes used more loosely to mean
any commit messages with a **consistent prefix or format that conveys meaning**.
Conventional and Angular commits are examples of semantic message conventions.
Some teams develop their own semantics – for instance, a team might prefix bug
fixes with `[Bug]` or features with `[Feature]` in the commit title. Others
might not follow the exact Conventional Commits syntax but still enforce that
the commit message starts with a category keyword. Semantic just implies the
commit message can be parsed or understood systematically (as opposed to
arbitrary messages). If not following a formal spec like Conventional Commits,
these approaches offer flexibility but may not integrate with tooling as
seamlessly. They are often tailored to a project’s specific needs. The key is to
define the categories and style in your project documentation so everyone
follows the same pattern.

### Other and Custom Conventions

Beyond the above, there are other niche or less common conventions:

- **Emojicommit:** Similar to Gitmoji in using emojis, but with a bit more
  structure in descriptions. Emojicommit encourages an emoji at the start and a
  message, but is more flexible about format than Conventional
  Commits【28†L40-L44】. It’s not widely adopted but some projects use it to have
  a more expressive commit log without strict type(scope) formatting.

- **Project-Specific Guidelines:** Some large projects or organizations have
  their own commit message style. For example, the Linux kernel community has a
  well-defined style (usually a short prefix for the subsystem, then a colon and
  message, with a detailed explanation in the body). Another example: some
  projects require referencing issue IDs in every commit or using certain
  keywords for internal processes. Always check if the repository you’re
  contributing to has a **CONTRIBUTING.md** or similar guide – it often contains
  the commit message conventions to follow.

- **Free-form (No Convention):** Many solo developers or small teams don’t adopt
  an explicit convention like Conventional Commits or Gitmoji. Instead, they
  just follow general good practices (like those in the previous sections) for
  writing clear commit messages. This is perfectly fine – the goal is
  communication. However, even solo developers might consider adopting a
  convention if they plan to open-source their project or if they want to use
  tools for automated changelogs/releases in the future. Consistency is what
  matters most. If you do go free-form, try to still be internally consistent
  (e.g., always use capitalized, imperative subjects, etc.).

**Choosing a Convention:** There’s no one-size-fits-all answer for which style
to use; it depends on your project needs and team preferences. If you need
strict semantic versioning and changelog generation, **Conventional Commits** is
a great choice (and many tools support it out of the box)【28†L59-L62】. If your
team enjoys visual cues and doesn’t mind adding an emoji to each commit,
**Gitmoji** can be layered on top (or used alone for a more informal
project)【28†L59-L62】. The **Angular style** is essentially a subset of
Conventional Commits (so choose Conventional for broader tool compatibility). If
you find the formal conventions too burdensome for a personal project, at least
follow the general best practices for clarity. The most important thing is that
everyone on the project follows the same approach – consistency makes
collaboration much smoother.

## Examples of Good vs. Poor Commit Messages

To solidify these concepts, let's look at some examples of well-written commit
messages versus poorly written ones. The differences should highlight the best
practices discussed:

| **Well-Written Commit Message** | **Poorly Written Commit Message** |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use specific, descriptive language:**<br>*Add `use` method to Credit model*
– Clearly states what is added *and* where【2†L85-L93】. The reader knows a method
was added to the `Credit` model. | *Add `use` method* – Too vague【2†L93-L100】.
Added where, to what? Lacks context, forcing the reader to guess or check the
diff. | | **Provide context and intent:**<br>*Increase left padding between
textbox and layout frame* – Describes the exact UI change【2†L99-L107】 (what was
changed and where), implying the intent (improve spacing in the UI). | *Adjust
css* – Unclear【2†L101-L107】. Which CSS? What was adjusted and why? There’s no
indication of the purpose or scope of this change. | | **Indicate the problem
being solved:**<br>*Fix method name of InventoryBackend child classes* – The
subject hints at a specific problem (method names were wrong)【2†L117-L124】. A
good commit would further explain the issue in the body (e.g. inconsistency with
the base class interface). | *Fix this* – No description at all【2†L152-L160】.
It's impossible to tell from the message *what* is being fixed. Similarly,
messages like *“it should work now”* or *“change stuff”* are meaningless without
context【2†L152-L160】. |

*Additional bad examples to avoid:* Commit messages that say nothing about the
change, like *“update code”*, *“final tweaks”*, or *“temporary”*. These violate
nearly all the best practices – they’re non-descriptive and create confusion
later. Always aim to leave a trail of *why* the code ended up the way it is.

On the other hand, a great commit message might even include a brief rationale
in the body. For instance, a good commit title *“Optimize image loading in
gallery”* could be followed by a body: *“Images are now lazy-loaded to improve
initial page render time.”* Such a commit is self-explanatory and saves future
maintainers a lot of effort in understanding the change.

## Tools and Linters for Commit Message Style

Maintaining consistent commit messages can be enforced with the help of various
tools. Especially in team environments or open-source projects, automated checks
can prevent bad commit messages from slipping in. Here are some popular tools
and methods:

- **Commitlint:** *Commitlint* is a widely used tool (usually in Node.js
  projects, but usable elsewhere) that lints commit messages against a set of
  rules. Typically, it’s used to enforce Conventional Commits. For example,
  Commitlint can check that your commit header has a type, isn’t too long, has a
  capitalized subject, etc. If a message doesn’t conform (e.g. missing a type or
  subject), it will throw an error and can reject the commit【22†L133-L142】.
  Commitlint is highly configurable; you can use the default
  **@commitlint/config-conventional** rules (which cover Conventional Commits
  format) or customize rules (for instance, to allow additional commit types or
  adjust length limits). Developers often integrate Commitlint into Git hooks or
  CI pipelines to automatically lint each commit.

- **Husky:** *Husky* is a tool for managing Git hooks in JavaScript/TypeScript
  projects. It makes it easy to run scripts when certain Git events occur (like
  committing or pushing). By using Husky, you can set up a **commit-msg hook**
  that runs Commitlint every time a commit is made. For example, in your
  project’s configuration you might add a Husky hook:
  `"commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"`【25†L63-L71】. This means
  whenever a commit message is entered, Commitlint will execute and validate the
  message. If the message breaks the rules, the commit will be aborted. Husky
  doesn’t enforce a standard by itself – it’s the mechanism to run checks – but
  together, **Husky + Commitlint** ensure that only properly formatted commits
  get through. (Husky can also run other checks like code linters or tests
  before push, but here we focus on commit message enforcement.) Tools like
  Husky are very helpful for solo devs too – they provide a safety net so you
  don’t accidentally make a sloppy commit message when in a rush.

- **Commitizen:** *Commitizen* is a command-line tool that guides developers to
  write commit messages in a standardized format. Instead of typing
  `git commit -m "..."` manually, you run `git cz` (after setting up
  Commitizen), and it will interactively prompt you for the type of change,
  scope, description, body, etc. This is extremely useful for ensuring
  Conventional Commits style without needing to remember the exact
  syntax【28†L40-L42】. Commitizen is often configured to use the Conventional
  Commits adapter by default (so it asks, e.g., is this a feat/fix/docs/etc.,
  what is the scope, etc.). It can be customized for other conventions too. For
  teams new to a commit convention, Commitizen lowers the learning curve – you
  just answer questions and it formats the message. This improves consistency
  and reduces the chance of mistakes.

- **Lint-staged:** Often mentioned alongside Husky, *lint-staged* is a tool to
  run linters on staged files (like ESLint for code). While not directly related
  to commit messages, it’s commonly used in tandem with Husky to ensure code
  quality on commit. In context of commit messages, lint-staged isn’t checking
  the message itself – Commitlint does that – but it’s worth noting as part of a
  commit-time quality enforcement toolkit【28†L42-L43】. Essentially, Husky
  triggers checks at commit time: Commitlint for the commit text, and
  lint-staged for the code being committed.

- **Pre-commit (framework):** In the Python ecosystem, there’s a *pre-commit*
  framework that can manage Git hooks for various languages/tools. It allows you
  to specify hooks in a config (.pre-commit-config.yaml), including a hook to
  validate commit messages. For example, there’s a hook that can ensure your
  commit message matches a regex or doesn't go over a certain length. This is
  analogous to what Commitlint does, though Commitlint with Conventional Commits
  rules is more full-featured for that specific purpose. If you’re not in a
  Node.js environment, using pre-commit hooks or Git’s own hooks with custom
  scripts can achieve similar enforcement.

- **CI Commit Checks:** Some projects employ Continuous Integration steps that
  verify commit messages. For instance, a CI job can run Commitlint (or a custom
  script) on the latest commits of a pull request and fail the build if any
  commit message is malformed. This is a backstop to catch issues that might
  slip past local hooks (or for contributors who haven’t set up the hooks).
  There are also GitHub Actions and other CI templates specifically for checking
  commit message formats.

- **Text Editor/IDE Plugins:** Many IDEs have plugins to help with commit
  message formatting. For example, there are plugins that highlight when your
  commit title exceeds 50 characters or that provide a template each time you
  write a commit (reminding you to fill out subject/body correctly). These can
  be useful for solo developers to get gentle reminders. Some version control
  GUI tools (like GitKraken or GitHub Desktop) also show a character count for
  the commit title, etc., to encourage good practices.

Using these tools, you can maintain a high standard of commit quality:

- **Example (Commitlint in action):** If you attempt to commit with a message
  that doesn’t meet the rules, e.g. just writing “Fix login issue”, the
  commit-msg hook will reject it. The error might say something like: *“subject
  may not be empty [subject-empty], type may not be empty
  [type-empty]”*【22†L133-L139】 – indicating you didn’t start with a type like
  `fix:` or your subject after the type was blank. You’d then be forced to
  rewrite the message in the proper format (for example, changing it to
  “fix(login): fix null pointer in login flow”). This immediate feedback ensures
  the repository history stays clean.

- **Gitmoji CLI:** As a side note, if you like Gitmoji, there are also CLI tools
  (like **gitmoji-cli**) that help you insert the right emoji code for your
  commit. These can be integrated with Commitizen or used standalone. They
  prompt you to pick an emoji (🐛 ✨ 📝 etc.) and then proceed with the commit
  message. This is more of a convenience tool than a linter, but it helps
  maintain consistency in using the correct emojis.

In summary, **commit message linters and tools** act as quality gates and
assistants. For open-source projects, setting up these tools is often part of
the repository scaffolding so that every contributor automatically follows the
convention (or is prompted to do so). For solo developers, they are like a
second pair of eyes – ensuring you don’t slip on your own standards. By
integrating commit message checks in your workflow, you bake best practices into
your development process.

## Conclusion

Writing clear commit messages might feel like extra work initially, but it pays
off immensely over time. A well-crafted commit history is like a story of the
project’s evolution – it reveals the *why* behind changes and serves as
documentation for future contributors (or your future self debugging an issue).
As a solo developer, adhering to these best practices means you will thank
yourself later when tracking down a bug or recalling why a change was made. In
open-source projects, good commit messages are a sign of professionalism and
respect for the maintainers and reviewers who read them. Adopting a structured
convention (like Conventional Commits) can further enhance consistency and
unlock automation (auto-generated changelogs, release versions, etc.), while
using visual cues like Gitmoji can make the history more approachable.

Finally, leveraging tools such as Commitlint and Husky helps enforce the
standards effortlessly – after a short adjustment period, writing a proper
commit message becomes second nature. In the end, the commit message is an
integral part of the code. By writing it well, you ensure the code’s intent and
