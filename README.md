## 🔄 Iterative Loops & Feedback Loops

Development is not strictly linear. Quality gates and feedback from later stages trigger refinement loops:

| Loop                         | Trigger                           | Flow                                                                               | Purpose                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Story Refinement**         | Quality issues in requirements    | `story-quality-gate` → `story-builder`                                             | Fix INVEST violations, incomplete acceptance criteria      |
| **Architecture Update**      | Risk/NFR gaps found               | `risk-and-nfr-gate` → `arch-spec-author`                                           | Address security/performance concerns before coding        |
| **Design Accessibility Fix** | A11y audit fails                  | `a11y-guardian` → `ui-scaffolder`                                                  | Ensure WCAG compliance before implementation               |
| **TDD Red→Green Cycle**      | Each behavior change (tight loop) | `test-drafter` (Red) → `implementation-driver` (Green) → `test-drafter` (Refactor) | Drive implementation with failing tests                    |
| **Test Coverage Gap**        | Coverage below threshold          | `test-truth-and-stability-gate` → `test-drafter`                                   | Add missing edge cases and scenarios                       |
| **Review Feedback Loop**     | Code review comments              | `code-reviewer` → `review-comment-fixer` → `code-reviewer`                         | Iterate on fixes until merge-ready                         |
| **Incident Follow-up**       | Post-incident learnings           | `incident-scribe` → `story-builder`                                                | Convert incident findings into future stories/improvements |

### Key Iteration Patterns

#### **TDD Loop (Tight Integration: Stages 4-5)**

The tightest loop is between **Implementation** and **Testing**, following **Red→Green→Refactor**:

```
Red Phase (test-drafter):
  └─> Write failing test based on acceptance criteria

Green Phase (implementation-driver):
  └─> Write minimal code to pass the test

Refactor Phase (implementation-driver):
  └─> Improve code structure while keeping tests green

Validation (test-truth-and-stability-gate):
  └─> Verify test quality, determinism, and coverage
```

#### **Quality Gate Loops (Stages 1-3)**

Stories and architecture are refined before implementation begins, reducing costly rework:

```
Requirements Stage:
  └─> story-builder creates story
  └─> story-quality-gate validates INVEST & DoR
  └─> If gaps found: ─> story-builder refines

Architecture Stage:
  └─> arch-spec-author creates design
  └─> risk-and-nfr-gate reviews security/NFRs
  └─> If issues found: ─> arch-spec-author refines
```

#### **Review Loop (Stage 6)**

Code review feedback drives refinement before merge:

```
code-reviewer comments on PR
  └─> review-comment-fixer implements changes
  └─> code-reviewer validates fixes
  └─> merge-readiness-auditor approves for merge
```

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 1. **INVEST User Stories**

All user stories must be **Independent**, **Negotiable**, **Valuable**, **Estimable**, **Small**, and **Testable**.

### 2. **Definition of Ready (DoR)**

Stories are not ready for implementation until:

- ✅ User value is clearly stated
- ✅ Success metrics are defined
- ✅ Acceptance criteria are complete (happy path + edge cases)
- ✅ Dependencies are identified
- ✅ Out of scope is explicit
- ✅ Data model impact is assessed
- ✅ Security/privacy implications are reviewed
- ✅ UX states are defined (loading, empty, error)

### 3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

Implementation follows **Red→Green→Refactor**:

- **Red**: Write failing tests first
- **Green**: Write minimal code to pass tests
- **Refactor**: Improve code structure while maintaining test green status

### 4. **Quality Gates**

Each stage has automated quality gates:

- Story validation (INVEST, testability)
- Accessibility audits (WCAG compliance)
- Architecture reviews (security, NFRs)
- CI quality checks (lint, tests, coverage)
- Code reviews (correctness, maintainability)
- Merge readiness audits
